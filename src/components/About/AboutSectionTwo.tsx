                MU5IC4GOOD was established in 2025 with the straightforward yet
                impactful goal of using music&#39;s universal language to build
                relationships and create life-changing opportunities for those
                who most need it. By utilizing the therapeutic potential of
                melody and rhythm, we&#39;re creating connections, dismantling
                obstacles, and ensuring taht every child has the opportunities
                to flourish.

                Our two founders Leo Zhang and Ethan Zhang grew up with a close
                fried who on the verge of being diagnosed with autism,
                struggling to communicate, connect, and develop. However, an
                unexpected miracle occured; he found a piano.

                Their close friend started to open up, learn, and thrive as
                melodies took the place of silence. It was then that our
                founders came to see that music was more than simply a pastime;
                it was an effective instrument of connection and healing. The
                idea that music can be more than just sound; that it can be
                therapy, support, and hope for kids with autism, was the
                inspiration behind MU5IC4GOOD. Using music, our goal is to build
                a bridge to a brighter future.
